# 1st-PHP-Project
This is my first PHP project 
A simple sign in page to a diary where the user can write whatever he loves in a textarea!
In this project, Sessions are used to keep the user signed in in all other pages of the project, cookies are used to allow the user to be signed in for
a whole day without the need of typing his username and password.
Database name is "assignment", and you can find the table of users in users.sql
